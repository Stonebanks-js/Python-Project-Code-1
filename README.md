# Python-Project-Code-1
This is the python project code that uses the idea of a Tic Tac Toe game and supports Jupyter Kernal commands. The logic used also applies on anaconda command prompt and has a wide range of functions. I suggest to use this code on Visual Studio Code for better outcome and apply the pylance extension for better visibility.
